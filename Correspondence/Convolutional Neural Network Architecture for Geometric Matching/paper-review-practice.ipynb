    "\n",
    "*We address the problem of determining correspondences\n",
    "between ***two images in agreement with a geometric model***\n",
    "such as an affine or thin-plate spline transformation, and\n",
    "estimating its parameters.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### *3 Contributions*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We propose a convolutional neural network architecture for geometric matching\n",
    "2. Demonstrate that the network parameters **can be trained from synthetically generated imagery without the need for manual annotation** and\n",
    "that our matching layer significantly increases generalization capabilities to never seen before images.\n",
    "3. Show that the same model can perform **both instance-level\n",
    "and category-level matching giving state-of-the-art results**\n",
    "on the challenging Proposal Flow dataset."
