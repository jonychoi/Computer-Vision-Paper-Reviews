    "<p>\n",
    "The recent work of Gatys et al. (2016) introduced a method for transferring a style from an image\n",
    "onto another one, as demonstrated in fig. 1. The stylized image matches simultaneously selected\n",
    "statistics of the style image and of the content image. Both style and content statistics are obtained\n",
    "from a deep convolutional network pre-trained for image classification. The style statistics are extracted from shallower layers and averaged across spatial locations whereas the content statistics are\n",
    "extracted form deeper layers and preserve spatial information. In this manner, the style statistics\n",
    "capture the “texture” of the style image whereas the content statistics capture the “structure” of the\n",
    "content image.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "Although the method of Gatys et. al produces remarkably good results, it is computationally inefficient. The stylized image is, in fact, obtained by iterative optimization until it matches the desired\n",
    "statistics. In practice, it takes several minutes to stylize an image of size 512 × 512. Two recent\n",
    "works, Ulyanov et al. (2016) Johnson et al. (2016), sought to address this problem by learning\n",
    "equivalent feed-forward generator networks that can generate the stylized image in a single pass.\n",
    "These two methods differ mainly by the details of the generator architecture and produce results of\n",
    "a comparable quality; however, neither achieved as good results as the slower optimization-based\n",

    "fact of comparable quality as the slow optimization method of Gatys et al. but can be obtained in\n",
    "real time on standard GPU hardware. The key idea (section 2) is to replace batch normalization layers in the generator architecture with instance normalization layers, and to keep them at test\n",
    "time (as opposed to freeze and simplify them out as done for batch normalization). Intuitively,\n",
    "the normalization process allows to remove instance-specific contrast information from the content\n",

    "\n",
    "The work of Ulyanov et al. (2016) showed that it is possible to learn a generator network g(x, z) that\n",
    "can apply to a given input image x the style of another x0, reproducing to some extent the results\n",
    "of the optimization method of Gatys et al. Here, the style image x0 is fixed and the generator g is\n",
    "learned to apply the style to any input image x. The variable z is a random seed that can be used to\n",
    "obtain sample stylization results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function g is a convolutional neural network learned from examples. Here an example is just a\n",

    "<img src=\"./imgs/figure3.png\" />\n",

    "where zt ∼ N (0, 1) are i.i.d. samples from a Gaussian distribution. The loss L uses a pre-trained\n",
    "CNN (not shown) to extracts features from the style x0 image, the content image xt, and the stylized\n",
    "image g(xt, zt), and compares their statistics as explained before.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "While the generator network g is fast, the authors of Ulyanov et al. (2016) observed that learning it\n",
    "from too many training examples yield poorer qualitative results. In particular, a network trained on\n",
    "just 16 example images produced better results than one trained from thousands of those. The most\n",
    "serious artifacts were found along the border of the image due to the zero padding added before every\n",
    "convolution operation (see fig. 3). Even by using more complex padding techniques it was not possible to solve this issue. Ultimately, the best results presented in Ulyanov et al. (2016) were obtained\n",

    "A simple observation is that the result of stylization should not, in general, depend on the contrast\n",

    "image to the content image such that the contrast of the stylized image is similar to the contrast\n",
    "of the style image. Thus, the generator network should discard contrast information in the content\n",

    "The generators used in Ulyanov et al. (2016) and Johnson et al. (2016) use convolution, pooling,\n",

    "contrast normalization function as a combination of such layers. To see why, let x ∈ R\n",
    "T ×C×W×H\n",
    "be an input tensor containing a batch of T images. Let xtijk denote its tijk-th element, where k and\n",

    "On the other hand, the generator network of Ulyanov et al. (2016) does contain a normalization\n",
