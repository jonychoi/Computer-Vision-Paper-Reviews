    "<p>\n",
    "Conditional image synthesis refers to the task of generating photorealistic images conditioning on certain input data. Seminal work computes the output image by\n",
    "stitching pieces from a single image (e.g., Image Analogies [16]) or using an image collection [7, 14, 23, 30, 35].\n",
    "Recent methods directly learn the mapping using neural networks [3, 6, 22, 47, 48, 54, 55, 56]. The latter methods are\n",
    "faster and require no external database of images.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    We are interested in a specific form of conditional image synthesis, which is converting a semantic segmentation\n",
    "mask to a photorealistic image. This form has a wide range\n",
    "of applications such as content generation and image editing [6, 22, 48]. We refer to this form as semantic image\n",
    "synthesis. In this paper, we show that the conventional network architecture [22, 48], which is built by stacking convolutional, normalization, and nonlinearity layers, is at best arXiv:1903.07291v2 [cs.CV] 5 Nov 2019\n",
    "suboptimal because their normalization layers tend to “wash\n",
    "away” information contained in the input semantic masks.\n",
    "To address the issue, we propose spatially-adaptive normalization, a conditional normalization layer that modulates the\n",
    "activations using input semantic layouts through a spatiallyadaptive, learned transformation and can effectively propagate the semantic information throughout the network.\n",
    "</p>\n",

    "    We conduct experiments on several challenging datasets\n",
    "including the COCO-Stuff [4, 32], the ADE20K [58], and\n",
    "the Cityscapes [9]. We show that with the help of our\n",
    "spatially-adaptive normalization layer, a compact network\n",
    "can synthesize significantly better results compared to several state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, an extensive ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed\n",

    "<strong>Conditional image synthesis</strong> exists in many forms that differ in the type of input data. For example, class-conditional\n",

    "category labels. Researchers have explored various models\n",
    "for generating images based on text [18,44,52,55]. Another\n",

    "type of conditional GANs [20, 22, 24, 25, 33, 57, 59, 60],\n",
    "where both input and output are images. Compared to\n",
    "earlier non-parametric methods [7, 16, 23], learning-based\n",
    "methods typically run faster during test time and produce\n",
    "more realistic results. In this work, we focus on converting\n",
    "segmentation masks to photorealistic images. We assume\n",
    "the training dataset contains registered segmentation masks\n",
    "and images. With the proposed spatially-adaptive normalization, our compact network achieves better results compared to leading methods.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "<strong>Unconditional normalization layers</strong> have been an important component in modern deep networks and can be found\n",
    "in various classifiers, including the Local Response Normalization in the AlexNet [29] and the Batch Normalization (BatchNorm) in the Inception-v2 network [21]. Other\n",
    "popular normalization layers include the Instance Normalization (InstanceNorm) [46], the Layer Normalization [2],\n",
    "the Group Normalization [50], and the Weight Normalization [45]. We label these normalization layers as unconditional as they do not depend on external data in contrast to\n",
    "the conditional normalization layers discussed below.\n",

    "first used in the style transfer task and later adopted in various vision tasks [3, 8, 10, 20, 26, 36, 39, 42, 49, 54]. Different from the earlier normalization techniques, conditional normalization layers require external data and generally operate as follows. First, layer activations are normalized to zero mean and unit deviation. Then the normalized activations are denormalized by modulating the\n",
    "activation using a learned affine transformation whose parameters are inferred from external data. For style transfer tasks [11, 19], the affine parameters are used to control\n",
    "the global style of the output, and hence are uniform across\n",

    "Wang et al. proposed a closely related method for image\n",
    "super-resolution [49]. Both methods are built on spatiallyadaptive modulation layers that condition on semantic inputs. While they aim to incorporate semantic information\n",
    "into super-resolution, our goal is to design a generator for\n",
    "style and semantics disentanglement. We focus on providing the semantic information in the context of modulating\n",
