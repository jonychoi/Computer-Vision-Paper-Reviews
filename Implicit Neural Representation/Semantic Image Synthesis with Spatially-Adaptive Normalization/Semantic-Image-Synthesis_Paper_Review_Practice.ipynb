    "<p>\n",
    "Conditional image synthesis refers to the task of generating photorealistic images conditioning on certain input data. Seminal work computes the output image by\n",
    "stitching pieces from a single image (e.g., Image Analogies [16]) or using an image collection [7, 14, 23, 30, 35].\n",
    "Recent methods directly learn the mapping using neural networks [3, 6, 22, 47, 48, 54, 55, 56]. The latter methods are\n",
    "faster and require no external database of images.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    We are interested in a specific form of conditional image synthesis, which is converting a semantic segmentation\n",
    "mask to a photorealistic image. This form has a wide range\n",
    "of applications such as content generation and image editing [6, 22, 48]. We refer to this form as semantic image\n",
    "synthesis. In this paper, we show that the conventional network architecture [22, 48], which is built by stacking convolutional, normalization, and nonlinearity layers, is at best arXiv:1903.07291v2 [cs.CV] 5 Nov 2019\n",
    "suboptimal because their normalization layers tend to “wash\n",
    "away” information contained in the input semantic masks.\n",
    "To address the issue, we propose spatially-adaptive normalization, a conditional normalization layer that modulates the\n",
    "activations using input semantic layouts through a spatiallyadaptive, learned transformation and can effectively propagate the semantic information throughout the network.\n",

    "spatially-adaptive normalization layer, a compact network\n",
    "can synthesize significantly better results compared to several state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, an extensive ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed\n",

    "in various classifiers, including the Local Response Normalization in the AlexNet [29] and the Batch Normalization (BatchNorm) in the Inception-v2 network [21]. Other\n",
    "popular normalization layers include the Instance Normalization (InstanceNorm) [46], the Layer Normalization [2],\n",

Different from the earlier normalization techniques, conditional normalization layers require external data and generally operate as follows. First, layer activations are normalized to zero mean and unit deviation. Then the normalized activations are denormalized by modulating the\n",
    "activation using a learned affine transformation whose parameters are inferred from external data. For style transfer tasks [11, 19], the affine parameters are used to control\n",

    "into super-resolution, our goal is to design a generator for\n",
