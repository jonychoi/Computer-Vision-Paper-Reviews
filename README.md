# Computer-Vision-Paper-Reviews

### Computer Vision Paper Reviews with Key Summary along Papers & Codes.

#### Jonathan Choi 2021

The repository provides 100+ Papers across Computer Vision fields converted as **Jupyter Notebook**, with the **Key Summary** and **End to End Code Practice**.

---

## Contents

The goal of the repository is providing an end to end study scripts of most read and important papers.

The prefered readers are not limited for researchers, but also for students and engieeners from rookies to the professions in computer vision fields .

To provide the perfect and rich understanding, each paper contains following three main contents.

### **Key Summary**

> Providing key summaries and terminologies of the paper so that even rookies can study as perfectly and easily as possible.

### **Code Practice**

> Providing an end to end study script of codes for the paper so that even rookies can study as easily and perfectly as possible.

### **Jupyter Notebook edited Original Paper**

> Providing the Original Paper converted into Jupyter notbook for easy and fast modification and understanding.
